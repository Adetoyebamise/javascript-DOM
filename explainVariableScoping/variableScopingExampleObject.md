#### Assignment Objective
>Explain Variable Scoping with examples using objects

##### Introduction

    Each variable has a scope, which is the part of the program in which the variable 
    is visible.For variable defined outside of any function or block, the scope is
    the whole programâ€” we can refer to such variable wherever we want. These
    are called __global__.
    But variable created for function parameters or declared inside a function
    can be referenced only in that function, so they are known as local variable.

 **Examples**
 >const football = {

  >   brand : 'mitre'

   >  type : '',

    > radius : 7,
    
  >   madeOfMaterial : 'leather',

 >}
